    Day 6 â€“ Task 4: Top 3 Products per Region using DENSE_RANK()
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Goal:
   Find the top 3 products in each region based on total revenue.
   Demonstrates practical use of DENSE_RANK() for ranking grouped data.

--  Notes:
-- - This pattern is very common in analytics and data engineering.
-- - DENSE_RANK() ensures ties are included fairly without skipping ranks.
-- - Limiting to top N (e.g., top 3) gives business insight per category.
--
--  Example Use Cases:
--   - Top 3 products per region (sales analysis)
--   - Top 5 employees by sales per department
--   - Top 10 customers by revenue per quarter
--
--  Can be reused in ETL workflows for generating summarized tables or dashboards.
