### 📘 **Day 2 – Sorting, Limiting & Conditional Logic**
| Task | Concepts Covered |
|------|------------------|
| DISTINCT | Find unique values |
| ORDER BY & LIMIT | Sort and restrict results |
| CASE WHEN | Apply conditional logic in queries |

**Key Takeaways:**
- Profiling datasets using `DISTINCT`.
- Ranking and filtering subsets.
- Categorizing results dynamically with `CASE`.

---

### 📘 **Day 3 – Aggregations & Grouping**
| Task | Concepts Covered |
|------|------------------|
| Basic Aggregates | `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX` |
| GROUP BY | Aggregate by category (region, country, etc.) |
| HAVING | Filter aggregated results |

**Key Takeaways:**
- Group and summarize data.
- Understand difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`.
- Derive KPIs like revenue per region.

---

### 📘 **Day 4 – Joins**
| Task | Concepts Covered |
|------|------------------|
| INNER JOIN | Combine matching data from multiple tables |
| LEFT & RIGHT JOIN | Include unmatched rows from one table |
| FULL OUTER JOIN | Combine all data from both tables |
| Join + Aggregation | Summarize joined datasets |

**Key Takeaways:**
- Learn relationship-based querying.
- Perform analytical summaries across related tables.

---

### 📘 **Day 5 – Subqueries & CTEs**
| Task | Concepts Covered |
|------|------------------|
| Subqueries | Nested queries for dynamic filtering |
| Common Table Expressions (CTEs) | Organize complex queries |
| Filtering with Subqueries | Use aggregated conditions inside `WHERE` |
