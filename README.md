# ðŸš€ Data Engineering Foundations

A hands-on learning repository designed to build **end-to-end data engineering skills** â€”  
starting from SQL fundamentals and progressing through Python, ETL pipelines, Airflow, Spark, and Cloud data workflows.

This repository documents my structured **Data Engineering Job-Readiness Roadmap**,  
complete with day-wise exercises, week-wise folders, datasets, and project-based learning.

## ðŸª„ How to Use

 1. **Clone this repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/lakshmisharath31/data-engineering-foundations.git
   cd data-engineering-foundations

 2. Explore Week-wise practice folders:
   Each week covers one major theme (SQL, Python, ETL, etc.)
   Inside each week, folders are organized day-wise
   Every day folder has its own .sql or .py scripts with examples and tasks

 3. Use the datasets:
   Located under /datasets
   You can load these into PostgreSQL, SQLite, or Pandas for practice

 4.Progress gradually:
   Week 1â€“2 â†’ SQL Fundamentals & Analytics
   Week 3â€“4 â†’ Python Data Engineering
   Week 5â€“6 â†’ ETL Projects
   Week 7â€“9 â†’ Spark, Cloud, Portfolio
